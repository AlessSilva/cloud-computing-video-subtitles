# DynamoDB

You will need 2 tables, one for the users and one for the videos.
The only configuration needed is to create the tables with the keys, as the attributes will be created as needed.

## users-table

* Set the `Primary key` as `user_id`

## videos-table

* Set the `Primary key` as `video_id`
